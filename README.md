Build algorithms for tidying spreadsheets with complicated layouts.

## Installation

You can install the development version of smeltr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("higherX4Racine/smeltr")
```

## Example

Many spreadsheets come with nested headings and wide, rather than tidy,
layouts. For example, the Federal government makes monthly reports about
[FAFSAÂ® Completion by High School and Public School
District](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/student/application-volume/fafsa-completion-high-school).
These spreadsheets have many complicated rows of headers, as you can see
below.

about FAFSA completion in WY</figcaption>

``` r
"extdata" |>
    system.file("WY.xls",
                package = "smeltr") |>
    smeltr::extract_headers_from_sheet(.sheet = "WY School Level Data",
                                       .nrows = 4) |>
    dplyr::select(-2) |>
    dplyr::mutate(
        dplyr::across(tidyselect::starts_with("Row"),
                      \(.)stringr::str_replace_all(., "\\n", "; "))
    ) |>
    tidyr::fill(tidyselect::starts_with("Row"), .direction = "down") |>
    knitr::kable()
```
